This repository is the source code for the visualisations of [AlphaFold 3 benchmark for RNA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.13.598780v2)
<br> It also contains the structures for each prediction for the <br> five test sets: `RNA_PUZZLES`, `CASP_RNA`, `RNASOLO`, `RNA3DB_0` and `RNA3DB_LONG`.

## Folder

You will find the following folders:
- `data`: contains the data used for the visualisation
  - `info`: contains metadata computed for the predictions or datasets. We advise not to compute it again (the command to run code to compute it is available in the `Makefile`)
  - `orphans`: contains original structures with or without context for the `RNA3DB_0` dataset. It can be downloaded at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JlXJ0G0H7YcXIEh_9LEmhBSkoaeuqg_1/view?usp=sharing)
  - `output`: contains the metrics computed for each prediction
  - `paper`: contains the figures used in the paper (main and supplementary)
  - `plots`: contains the plots generated for the visualisation. This is where are saved the outputs of the visualisation code available in this repository.
  - `pdb`: contains the structures predicted by AlphaFold 3 and the benchmarked models. 
   Should be downloaded at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGc9eBM4SYE4UnMI04n6EOa82lfVIjL7/view?usp=sharing). 
- `src`: contains the source code for the visualisations
- `Makefile`: file with the main commands summarized
- `environment.yml`: file with the different python requirements to run the code

## Installation

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate af3
```

## Data

<img src="data/paper/example_structure.gif" alt="Example Structure" width="300">
</div>


To get all the `.pdb` files, you have to unzip the [pdb folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGc9eBM4SYE4UnMI04n6EOa82lfVIjL7/view?usp=sharing).
If you need the original structures for the `RNA3DB_0` dataset (with the context), you can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JlXJ0G0H7YcXIEh_9LEmhBSkoaeuqg_1/view?usp=sharing).

Note that to run the visualisations, you do not need to have the original `.pdb` files. 
Visualisations are made from either metadata or directly computed scores (available in the `data/output` folder).


## Visualisations

### Raw visualisations

To reproduce the visualisation available in `data/plots`, you just need to use:

```bash
make viz_alphafold
```

or its python equivalent:

```bash
python -m src.viz_alphafold
```

It will save the plots in the `data/plots` folder.

You will find some of the following plots:

Bar chart       |                        nWC plot                         |                        Scatter plot                         |                           Scatter mean                           
:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
![](data/plots/figures/bar/CASP-RNA.png) | ![](data/plots//figures/nwc/INF-WC_INF-NWC_by_RMSD.png) | ![](data/plots/figures/scatter/main_metrics_vs_seq_len.png) | ![](data/plots/figures/scatter_mean/mean_metrics_vs_seq_len_all_models_scatter_25.png) | 

To further see which code is used to generate the visualisations, you can check the `src/viz_alphafold.py` file.

Particularly, you can have a look at the `run` method: 

```python
    def run(self):
        df = self.get_merged_model_df()
        table_helper = TableHelper(df, self.save_dir)
        table_helper.run()
        table_helper.show_context_vs_no_context()
        ComputePValue(df).run()
        nwc_helper = NWCHelper(df, self.save_dir)
        nwc_helper.get_viz()
        scatter_helper = ScatterHelper(df, self.save_dir)
        scatter_helper.get_viz()
        scatter_helper.get_viz_mean()
        scatter_helper.get_viz_diff()
        BarHelper.get_viz()
```

Each class corresponds to a different type of plot, which are available in the `src/viz` folder. 

### Paper visualisations

The clean visualisations of the paper are available in the `data/paper` folder.

## Optional code

### Metrics computation
If you want to reproduce the metrics computation, we used the [RNAdvisor](https://github.com/EvryRNA/rnadvisor) tool, using:

```bash
make compute_metrics
```

Otherwise, the scores are already computed and available in the `data/output` folder.

### Statistics

To get the statistics of the datasets, you can use the following command:

```bash
make stats
```

### Interactions

First, you would need to install the [RNA_Assessment](https://github.com/RNA-Puzzles/RNA_assessment) library.

To install it, I have made a fork of the original repository with the necessary changes:

```bash
make install_rna_assessment
```

Then, you can compute the interactions for each prediction, using:

```bash
make count_interactions
```

Note that you will need to have a linux system to run the code (because of the MC-Annotate tool).
