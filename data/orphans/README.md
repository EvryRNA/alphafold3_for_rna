# Orphan structures

This folder contains the raw structures used for the RNA3DB_0 with context dataset. 

You can download it at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JlXJ0G0H7YcXIEh_9LEmhBSkoaeuqg_1/view?usp=sharing). 

You can find:

- `af3_context_alone`: the extracted structures from the AlphaFold 3 predictions (from the context structures).
- `af3_with_context`: the raw structures predicted by AlphaFold 3 (with the full context).
- `native`: the raw structures of RNA3DB_0 with the full context. Note that the extracted structures are available in the `data/pdb/RNA3DB` folder.
